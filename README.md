A personal project.I just try to implement some useful starter for spring boot.Now I have projects as below:
* keycloak-enforcer-webflux-starter: the stater is used for integrate keycloak and spring boot oauth2.It's born out of <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/main/authz/policy-enforcer">keycloak-policy-enforcer</a>, and it's the webflux version.
* cafe-logger-spring-boot-starter: a aop logger starter.It will wave logger aspect dynamically according to configuration to record method level input\output.
* ...

I will use my free time to improve the projects in this repo
